# Ansible Proxmox Kubernetes Cluster Deployment
This Ansible project automates the deployment of a 4-node Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox. The process involves creating a Proxmox VM template, configuring VM settings, and provisioning the cluster.

## üìå Prerequisites
Before running the playbooks, ensure you have:

1. A running Proxmox VE server.
2. Ansible installed on your control machine.
3. SSH key-based authentication set up between the control machine and Proxmox.
4. A vm template created in Proxmox with ansible control machine ssh-key copied in it eg ssh-copy-id root@template_ip.

## üîß Setup Instructions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare the Proxmox Template
1. Create a ubuntuVM template on Proxmox.

2. Copy your SSH public key to the Proxmox template to allow Ansible to access it.
```
ssh-copy-id root@PROXMOX_IP
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Variables
Edit vm_vars_config.yml inside playbooks directory with your Proxmox API details and VM configurations:
```
PROXMOX_API_URL: "https://PROXMOX_IP:8006/api2/json"
PROXMOX_USER: "your-proxmox-user"
PROXMOX_PASSWORD: "your-api-token"

# Change based on your template id and name convention
TEMPLATE_VMID: 500
DEFAULT_IP: "192.168.1.3" # Should be your default vm template ip

VM_1_VMID: 805
VM_1_NAME: "proxy-node1"
VM_1_IP: "192.168.1.80"

VM_2_VMID: 806
VM_2_NAME: "master-node1"
VM_2_IP: "192.168.1.81"

VM_3_VMID: 807
VM_3_NAME: "worker-node1"
VM_3_IP: "192.168.1.82"

VM_4_VMID: 808
VM_4_NAME: "worker-node2"
VM_4_IP: "192.168.1.83"
```
Modify the file if you need more or fewer nodes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure SSH Access to Proxmox
Ensure your SSH public key is copied to Proxmox:
```
ssh-copy-id root@PROXMOX_IP
```
### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Update kube_inventory File
Edit kube_inventory to define your Proxmox server:
```
[Proxmox-server]
PROXMOX_HOSTNAME ansible_host=PROXMOX_IP
```

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Ansible Playbook
Execute the Ansible playbook to deploy the VMs:

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini  main.yml
```
## üöÄ Playbook Overview

This Ansible project automates the provisioning of a 4-node Kubernetes cluster on Proxmox. The playbook follows these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Load Environment Variables
The playbook begins by loading configuration settings from vm_vars_config.yml.

These variables include Proxmox API details, VM template ID, and node-specific configurations.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone VMs from the Template
The playbook clones new VMs from the existing Proxmox cloud-init template.

VM names, VMIDs, and IP addresses are assigned dynamically from the vm_vars_config.yml.
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Start and Configure VMs
Each cloned VM is started and configured one by one.

The configure_vm.yml playbook is included for per-VM configuration.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Network and Host Configuration
The playbook waits for SSH to be available on the default IP (192.168.1.3).

It configures static IPs, hostnames, and updates DNS settings.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Apply Changes and Reboot VMs
The hostname is set, and the system is rebooted to apply new settings.
### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Copy SSH Public Key to All Hosts
Once the VMs are back online, the playbook copies the Ansible controller's SSH public key to all master and worker nodes.

This step ensures passwordless SSH access for seamless automation in subsequent steps.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Time Synchronization
The playbook installs and configures NTP on all nodes to synchronize time.

Accurate timekeeping is essential for Kubernetes components like etcd and certificate validation.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Install Kubernetes Dependencies on Master Nodes
The playbook installs required Kubernetes packages (`kubeadm`, `kubelet`, `kubectl`) and container runtime (e.g., containerd) on all master nodes.

It also disables swap and configures sysctl parameters.

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Install Kubernetes Dependencies on Worker Nodes
Similarly, Kubernetes dependencies and container runtimes are installed on worker nodes.

These are prepared to join the cluster once the master is initialized.

### üîü Set Up Kubernetes Clusters (Green & Blue)
Two separate Kubernetes clusters are initialized using `kubeadm init` ‚Äî one labeled "Green" and the other "Blue".

Kubeconfig files are saved, and the control plane is prepared for joining worker nodes.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Join Worker Nodes to Respective Clusters
Worker nodes are joined to either the Green or Blue Kubernetes cluster using the respective `kubeadm join` command.

This creates two isolated environments for deployment and testing.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Namespaces and Deploy Base Services
The playbook performs post-cluster configuration tasks:

- Creates necessary Kubernetes namespaces
- Deploys and exposes an NGINX deployment as a sample workload
- Installs the Kubernetes Dashboard for visual cluster management
- Sets up Jenkins service accounts and roles for CI/CD integration
